# Library System
#### A school project of a functional library system.
The program is made to imitate a functional library system. Test cases will be run at the start of the program and will prevent usage if any of them fail.
The test cases aren't verbose, and you'll therefore not be notified of them running unless one should fail.\
Basic functions include:
 - Creating and deleting members
 - Creating and deleting books
 - Updating details on books and members
 - Renting and returning books

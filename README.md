# Library System
#### A school project of a functional library system.
The program is made to imitate a functional library system. Test cases will be run at the start of the program and will prevent usage if any of them fail.
The test cases aren't verbose, and you'll therefore not be notified of them running unless one should fail.\
Basic functions include:
 - Creating and deleting members
 - Creating and deleting books
 - Updating details on books and members
 - Renting and returning books
<br/>

#### Want to run the code on your system?

1. Download the project as a zip.
2. Extract the folder in a place you see fit.
3. Open your cmd and change to the directory the project is located in.
4. Run the command ``Python main.py``
5. Enjoy.
